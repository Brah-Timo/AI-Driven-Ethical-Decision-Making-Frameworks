## 1. Concept Overview

The AI-Driven Ethical Decision-Making Framework aims to provide businesses with tools that help analyze decisions through an ethical lens and ensure that their AI systems adhere to ethical guidelines. This application will facilitate responsible decision-making and foster trust in AI technologies.
## 2. Key Features
2.1 Ethics Advisor for Businesses

    Decision Analysis: AI tools that analyze proposed business decisions, evaluating potential ethical implications based on established ethical frameworks.
    Scenario Simulation: Users can simulate various decision-making scenarios to see potential outcomes, helping to identify ethical risks and benefits.
    Recommendations and Insights: Provide actionable recommendations for ethical practices, including considerations related to stakeholders, social responsibility, and long-term impacts.
    Stakeholder Impact Assessment: Analyze how decisions affect various stakeholders (employees, customers, communities) and suggest measures to mitigate negative impacts.

2.2 Transparent AI Governance

    Ethical Guidelines Repository: A centralized repository of ethical guidelines and best practices for AI development and deployment, customizable based on industry standards.
    Accountability Mechanisms: Built-in tools to document decision-making processes, ensuring accountability and traceability of AI system actions.
    Compliance Monitoring: Monitor AI systems for adherence to ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements, generating reports to demonstrate compliance.
    Stakeholder Engagement: Tools for engaging stakeholders in discussions about ethical practices and obtaining feedback on AI governance.

## 3. Technology Stack
3.1 Frontend Development

    Frameworks: Use React or Vue.js to build a responsive and interactive user interface.
    Data Visualization Libraries: Implement libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for visualizing ethical implications and decision scenarios.

3.2 Backend Development

    Framework: Node.js with Express or Django for Python to handle RESTful APIs and backend logic.
    Database: Use PostgreSQL for structured data management related to decisions, scenarios, and guidelines.

3.3 AI and Machine Learning

    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use NLP techniques to analyze text input related to business decisions and extract ethical considerations.
    Machine Learning Models: Develop models to simulate decision-making scenarios and predict ethical outcomes based on historical data.




## React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
